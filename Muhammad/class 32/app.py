# car is a variable
# = is an assignment operator
# "bmw" is a value and it is a string

# Examples by Mohammed
car = "bmw"

if (car == "bmw"):                              
    print ("yay bmw")

# example #2
if (3 > 4) :
   print(" four is grater then 1")
elif (5 > 4):
   print("5 is grater then 4")
else : 
    print ("no numbers")


# Operators => Something that operates an operand
# comparison => When you compare something

# > is greater than operator
if (3 > 4) :
   print(" four is grater then 1")
#    == is called an equal comparison operator
elif (5 == 4):
   print("5 is grater then 4")
# less than operator
elif (8 < 6):
    print("")
# != is not equal
elif (8 != 6):
    print("")
else : 
    print ("no numbers")
